## Project Goal
While existing research provides valuable insights into current common-use generative AI products, it doesn’t fully address the complexities of next-generation AI applications, specifically, AI agent interfaces. While agent modalities are still in their infancy and have not yet been fully explored in design frameworks, we hope to start filling this gap.

## Introduction
The rise of AI agents is capable of acting on users’ behalf (e.g., booking flights, ordering groceries). At the same time, there are associated risks of unintended or harmful actions.
